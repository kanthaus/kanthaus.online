So you'd like to visit us? Great! Read on...

## Hosting
To visit Kanthaus you'll need a host. A host is a current Volunteer or Member who is happy to show you around, introduce you to others and generally be responsible for making sure you and others have a Good Time™. Because people are quite busy here, it's not certain that there will always be someone available to host you, so please arrange this **before you arrive**. You can contact us via [Slack](https://slackin.yunity.org) or [email](mailto:hello@kanthaus.online), or if you know someone who can host you, you can just arrange it through them.

## Safety
The buildings were built in the 1880s and have suffered decades of questionable building practices. Our ongoing renovation works mean that some parts of Kanthaus are more or less building-sites. We must ask you to take responsibility for your safety and to be generally observant. Please be aware of:
- Sharp objects on the floor/ground. (Take care if walking barefoot.)
- Dangerously hot water coming from the kitchen, snack kitchen and main bathroom hot taps when the sun shines.
- [Hylotox 59 pesticide](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylotox) (Lindane and DDT) in the wood of the attic: please read and follow safety signs before going there.

## Accessibility
Unfortunately Kanthaus has accessibility issues: everything is spread out over 3 floors and there are three steps at the front door. If you have issues with accessibility and would like to visit, please let us know about your needs and we can talk about how/if we can make it work.

## Rules
We have a [Constitution](/governance/constitution) and [Collective Agreements](/governance/collectiveagreements/) which you accept by visiting. These documents outline the processes and rules we have set for ourselves. Just to highlight two points: we do not permit indoor smoking and we wish to discuss bringing non-human animals (e.g. dogs) on a case-by-case basis. Additionally:
- Please do not up- or download any illegal content.
- Please be quiet in the garden after 22.00 and limit grilling/garden fires out of respect for our neighbors.

## Other info
- There is no individual price for staying here; we have collective costs of ~€15,000 p.a. If you would like to donate, you can.
- We practice functional living and don't allocate personal rooms by default. If this topic is new to you or if you'd like a room reserved for you, please talk to your host.
- It is possible to stay at Kanthaus longer, but it depends on multiple factors. First just come for a visit and see how that works out. If staying longer is of interest to you, talk to your host about [positions and evaluations](/governance/positionsandevaluations).
- You're host should give you a house tour and explain the basics soon after your arrival. If you want a sneak peak you can already read [the accompanying document](visiTour).

The address is [Kantstraße 20, Wurzen 04808](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=20%20kantstrasse%20wurzen#map=19/51.36711/12.74075&layers=N). Please mention "phancy physalis" when you first contact us so that we know you've read this document.

Kanthaus eagerly awaits you!
