title: Renovation of the house
description: All the manual work that still is to do
---

**We want to make the houses in Kantstra√üe 20 and 22 into the spaces we dream of!** <br>
That means that there is still a lot to do...

===

### What do we want?

The general idea is that we want a space which is suitable for focused work on projects, while at the same time providing us with everything we need to actually _live_ there and have a nice, homely community life. We want to support others with our infrastructure, and we want to have room to be alone. We want a design that naturally divides the space into areas of either work, play or retreat. We want everything to work easily, for newcomers as well as for people who have been Kanthausians for a longer period of time already. We want the structure of the house to support our social structure, and in the longer run we also want everything to look kinda good.

To bring all these dreams together and to then make them reality is no easy task!

### How do we manage this?

[GitLab](https://handbook.kanthaus.online/digital/gitlab.html) is our place for collecting all the things that still need to be done. It might be a bit overwhelming for people who are not accustomed to it, so here is a small guide:

- Each task has one _issue_. Issues work like forum threads, so all relevant info can be stored inside the issue.
- Who feels responsible for resolving an issue will _assign_ themselves to the specific issue. This means that they have the motivation and skill to take on the task. There can be multiple people assigned to one issue.
- Issues can have _labels_, which make them easier to filter. In our case there are labels like 'construction' and 'administrative' that refer to the kind of work that needs to be done, 'remote' and 'deutsch' that clarify if one needs to be present in Wurzen or have German skills to work on a task, and others.
- Issues can also belong to a _milestone_, this is what we use for our [roadmap plannings](https://handbook.kanthaus.online/roadmap.html). That means that e.g. 'Autumn 2018' is a milestone in the logic of GitLab. Issues which don't belong to any roadmap might not have a clear expiry date.
- In the search bar on the issues page you can use labels, milestones and - of course - text to _filter_ the issues and find those that interest you.
- Next to the search bar you can specify how to _sort_ the issues. 'Last updated' gives you the tasks with the most recent activity first.
- As soon as a task is done or no longer relevant its issue will be _closed_. No issue will ever get deleted.

_This is the list of all issues_

In the picture above you can see all the before-mentioned elements:
- On top you can see that there are 60 open issues, 83 closed ones and 143 in total.
- Below that there's the search bar with the menu to choose the sorting options next to it.
- Then follows the list of all issues.
- The first line on the left of an issue consists of its title and an optional sub-task overview.
- The second line starts with the number of the issue, followed by the time of its creation and the name of its creator.
- The labels are the colored badges at the end of the 2nd line on the left.
- On the top right in each issue you can see how many messages that issue holds and who is its assignee, if there is any.
- Below that is indicated when the issue was last updated.
