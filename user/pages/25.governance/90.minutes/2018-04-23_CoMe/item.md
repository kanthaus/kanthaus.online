<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Message by Findus via slack: hey Olli, who is coming to the lu meeting wants to know if he can bring his little well behaved dog? also: Would it be ok, if some of us stay till monday/tuesday?-> Matthias answered privately that the dog is likely not a problem but will check today. 
 -> OK. So it is likely, that ~10 people from LU will stay for some more days.
- Check-in round before come / all meetings? -> No real consensus; just try it out at next CoMe; People are encouraged to come to next CoMe at 9.50 and we start with a very short personal sharing round, regular CoMe then at 10.00.
- Garden: Idea with isabell/laurina/matthias to make the area around the cherry trees more grassy-usable. For that, would remove some more trees/bushes; want to build a hedge towards sven or leave it open?
 -> Fine to do that. Please don't cut down anything big. Decide yourself where you want replant them :-) Hedge vs no hedge had no strong opinions.
We are out of toilet paper (Adam will get some)
-> Isabell suggested to by recycled toilet paper as it is cheaper as well as more environmentally friendly
- Adam is inventorizing our medicine cabinet currently. There will be a list accessible on air-table. He suggests using plastic bags for sorting/storage and asks about other opinions. -> Temporarily do it like that, we are free to redo it at another time differently.
There is hot water in the snack kitchen and the upper bathroom heated from solar power now. Its not extensive but enough especially on sunny days.
