  - "Dear all, My name is Ollie Nathan and I am interested in your housing project. I will be joining you on Sunday or Monday next week. I wish to carry out a little bit of research with you. I hope to carry out 1:1 interviews followed by potentially 1 group interview. *each running for 15/20 minutes). I am interested in learning more about alternative housing and exposing the narratives of individuals involved. My experience thus far is mostly with co-ops. I hope that this work can contribute towards a spring board built up to inspire and strengthen others to start up similar projects like yours. The vision is to accelerate a movement towards equity and sharing. Info shared can be kept anonymous and I will be happy to talk in person about how the information will be shard and used. Feel free to take part, not take part, ask questions etc ;-) Thanks and see you soon, Ollie Nathan."
