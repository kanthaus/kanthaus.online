### §1. Preamble
Kanthaus is an open-entry common-space dedicated to the common good. It is governed in three layers—

1. The Constitutional layer outlines _who decides what should happen and how_. This includes core agreements such as Purposes, Positions and Procedures. Agreements at this level support and supersede agreements in the following layers. It is documented in the Constitution (this document) and supported by the [FAQ](../governancefaq/). Only the english original version of this document is binding.
1. The Collective layer outlines _what should happen_. This layer contains other formal agreements such as policies, schedules and best-practices. Agreements at this level support and supersede agreements in the Operational layer. It is documented in [the Collective Agreements](../collectiveagreements/).
1. The Operational layer describes _what actually happens_. This layer contains unconscious, informal and semi-formal agreements such as norms, sub-group agreements and spontaneous activity. It is not centrally documented.

<a name="evaluation"></a>

### §6. Evaluation Procedure
1. Volunteers, Members and the person to be evaluated (herein 'the person') meet. The person should request the position they desire and the group can openly discuss topics such as—
	1. the role the person could see for themself,
	1. problems or blocked opportunities, or
	1. understanding of the Constitution and/or Collective Agreements.
1. Following the discussion with the person, the voters meet privately—
  1. if the person requests to become a Visitor or Volunteer; Volunteers and Members vote, or
  1. if the person requests to become a Member; Members vote.
1. Before further discussion, the voters make an anonymous test vote on whether they ‘support’ (+), ‘accept’ (0) or ‘oppose' (-) the person being adopted at their requested position.
1. The voters may then discuss the person, the Position they requested and the outcome of the test vote. There should be an emphasis to raise and address concerns.
1. Finally the voters take a binding vote in the same way as the test vote (§6.3.) This time—
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the person is adopted at their requested position, or
	1. else the evaluation returns to point §6.2. as if the person had requested the next lower position (cf. §5).
1. The person should be promptly informed of which position they were accepted at, but not the breakdown of votes. Any outstanding feedback from the private discussion should also be passed on as helpful feedback.

<a name="indact"></a>

### §7. Operational Activity
#### §7a. Individual Action
1. Any person may take action provided—
	1. there is no outstanding opposition towards it, and
	1. they assume personal responsibility for it.
1. There is no specific format for Individual Action. Depending on the situation it could be appropriate for a person to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), to first [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or to [announce their proposal](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
1. Any person who is opposed towards an Individual Action should communicate it early, clearly and kindly.
1. If an Individual Action receives opposition it should be stopped and the individuals involved should proceed with Unanimous Acceptance (§7b.)

<a name="uniaccept"></a>

#### §7b. Unanimous Acceptance
1. Unanimous Acceptance towards an action is achieved when no person opposes it.
1. There is no specific format for achieving Unanimous Acceptance. Many tools and techniques exist which may help, including: small-scale testing, presentation, debate, meetings with [planned agendas](http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Agenda_Planning), rounds, [talking sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_stick), [hand-signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals), [speaker-lists](http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Taking_Stack_(Meeting_Facilitation_Technique)) or time-limits.
1. If Unanimous Acceptance cannot be achieved in an acceptable time-frame, the individuals involved should proceed with Score Voting (§7c.). Proceeding to Score Voting should be done with Unanimous Acceptance, or failing that, by simple majority.

<a name="scorevote"></a>

#### §7c. Score Voting
1. Individuals should discuss the current situation and generate alternative proposals. The proposals are then listed with the addition of two control proposals—
	1. 'status quo' (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and
	1. 'escalate procedure' (i.e. 'switch to Collective Change'.)
1. The individuals then score the proposals as 'support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose'. The total score for each proposal is found by counting 'support' as 1, 'accept' as 0 and 'oppose' as -3. The proposal with the highest total score is selected.

<a name ="collagrchange"></a>

### §8. Changing the Collective Agreements
1. All changes to the Collective Agreements must be using the following procedure.
1. The procedure is initiated when all in-space Members and Volunteers have been notified of a clear and explicit proposal from a Member or Volunteer which—
	1. has the support of at least 1 other Member or Volunteer, and
	1. does not go against any other Collective Change made within the last 6 days.
1. The proposal phase of the procedure lasts at least 3 days during which Volunteers and Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of this phase the proposals are listed with the addition of two control proposals—
	1. 'status quo' (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and
	1. 'escalate procedure' (i.e. 'switch to Constitutional Change'.)
1. The decision phase of the procedure lasts at least 3 days during which Volunteers and Members should individually yet identifiably score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) At the end of the decision phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and
	1. the Collective Agreements should be changed to reflect the decision.

<a name="constchange"></a>

### §9. Changing the Constitution
1. All changes to the Constitution must be made using the following procedure.
1. The procedure is initiated when all Members, both resident and remote, are notified of a clear and explicit proposal from a Member which—
	1. has the support of at least 2 other Members, and
	1. does not go against any other Constitutional Change made within the last 28 days.
1. The proposal phase of the procedure lasts at least 7 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of this phase the proposals are listed with the addition of the 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing'.)
1. The decision phase of the procedure lasts at least 7 days during which Members should individually yet identifiably score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) At the end of this phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled, and
  1. the proposal with the highest total is selected.
1. A proposal becomes the final decision if selected in two consecutive rounds. This means that at least two proposal phases and two decision phases are required for a decision, potentially more. When a decision is reached the Constitution should be amended to reflect this decision.

### §10. Conflict Resolution
#### §10a. Direct
1. Individuals are generally encouraged to resolve their conflicts directly.
1. There is no specific format for Direct Conflict Resolution. Many techniques and tools exist to prevent potential conflicts, manage ongoing conflicts and analyze resolved conflicts, including: the [Advice Process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making), [Non-violent Communication](http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/), [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/), [Sharing Circles](url), [1-on-1 dialogue](url), [Listen Looping, I-messages and Non-defensive Assertions.](https://loomio.coop/conflict_resolution_resources.html)

<a name="volass"></a>

#### §10b. Voluntary Assistance
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict directly prove unsuccessful, individuals involved in a conflict (herein 'actor') may voluntarily seek and/or accept assistance from third-parties.
1. There is no specific format for Conflict Resolution with Voluntary Assistance. On the basis that all involved consent to participate, many scenarios are possible, including—
	1. an external individual supporting an involved individual ('support person',)
	1. an external individual supporting multiple involved individuals ('direct bridge',)
	1. support people engaging in dialogue on behalf of the involved individuals ('indirect bridge',) or
	1. a group of external individuals attend a meeting of the involved individuals to witness and/or offer advice ('panel'.)

<a name="intervention"></a>

#### §10c. Intervention
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict with Voluntary Assistance prove unsuccessful, Members may intervene as a last resort.
1. Conflict Resolution by Intervention is decided by Members using the Unanimous Acceptance (8b.) or Score Voting (8c.) procedure, where proposals may include—
	1. requesting an individual to participate in assisted conflict resolution,
	1. revoking an individuals' position of Volunteer or Member, or
	1. instructing an individual to leave the space temporarily or indefinitely.
