- [Tilmann] There's a calender entry about when we want to have a "month of ???"

    - Today at 5 pm.

- [Thore] There is a new corona framework, see discussion on Slack
    - How to plan travels wrt points, not to exceed the limit?
        - The idea is to discuss beforehand, preferably in CoMe.
        - There will be a section specifically for it starting next CoMe.
        - Some points should be left for spontaneous activities.
        - Everything should also be posted to #kanthaus-corona to have it transparent how many points are left.
        - Calculation: 15 + 10 + 8 + some yet uncalculated points that will be added to Slack
