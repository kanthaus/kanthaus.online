### 4. Discussion & Announcements
#### Round 1

- [Janina] The Christmas committee has several proposals for the time from December 24th until December 26th.
    - Here's the pad with detailed information: https://codi.kanthaus.online/christmasOrga?edit
    - There will be a Christmas Open Stage! If you can think of any song, poem, story, game or whatever you want to share, please do so on the 24th!
    - Anja will make a lot of potato dumplings on the 25th. She will already prepare the potatoes on the 24th and would be happy about help.
    - For the Christmas brunch on the 25th it would be nice if people made spreads and salads and such.
    - Christmas will take place in the kitchen, the dining room, the elephant room and the piano room. If you want to work during that time, maybe choose another location... ;) If you like decorating, please knock yourself out! :D
- [Silvan] MOI date 5.2.-19.2.?
    - Let's make it a fixed appointment!
    - [Matthias] There will be prep time before, when exactly would that start?
    - [Nathalie] A week of prep time could be nice.
    - [Matthias] How about a prep session on the 29th of January to figure out the details?
    - Spounds good!
- [Tilmann] Mika caretaker organization
  - from now on, you are invited to start taking care of Mika for one day or more! Suggested handover during breakfast. You can team up with somebody to make it even more enjoyable. 
  - there's a list on top of Mika's shelf in the dining room, where you can write your name down. The list should be wiped every Monday.
- [Kito] my new name ist Kito :) thanks for your proposals and voting
- [matthias] How to handle Corona tests?
    - [Doug] I think you need to come up with a process proposal and then we can talk about that
    - [Silvan] my aunt offered to train us in carrying out the tests
    - [Matthias] would be nice to get more comments on the post I already did on Slack, otherwise I wouldn't do anything. I don't feel like driving this process myself.
- [Doug] 'How shall we go Forward with corona?' Collective agreement, starting Jan 2 for 6 days
    - I would start an ukuvote with a 3 day proposal phase and a 3 day voting phase.
    - The new framework would be part of the initial proposal, but there can be more.

#### Round 2

- [Talita] the Winter Solstice is today at 11:02 CET (i.e. local time)
- [zui] two hours left for the child name ukuvote: https://ukuvota.world/#/app/45d5cde6-af4a-03b0-d8e8-c759f1e63235/vote
- [Silvan] Post Woman Present?
    - Goji/Maulbeeren-Mix? 
    - [Bodhi] I think it would be cooler to give money because it's always hard to know what people like.
    - [Bodhi] If someone would be up for it they could make some cards which we prepare with some money (like 10€) and then we give them out to delivery people everytime we get a package.
    - [Talita] I can make some cards.
    - [Matthias] will make a list to record which company's people we already gave a card to and hang it up next to the entrance.
