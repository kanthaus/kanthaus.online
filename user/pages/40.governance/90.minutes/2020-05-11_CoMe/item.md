<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, solar intake, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!) 
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit new file" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.     
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Check the shoe!
  - Have fun!

##### Daily averages for last week
<!-- Read counters in heating room and append to water.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146415 and gas.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146411. Strongly knock against the display of the solar inverter in K20 Basement material storage and put the E-Total kWh in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146414 solar.csv, take the difference between your and the last value and multiply it with 0.285 €/kWh and divide by 7 days to have the solar intake per day. update the residence record (https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/residenceRecord.csv) otherwise the script will complain -->

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Janina] There is an unpleasant smell in the snack kitchen. Any ideas what it is and what can be done about it?
    - [Tilmann] The siphon behind the tumble drier was dried, I refilled it with water and covered it with a sheet of plastic.
    - Awesome, thanks!
- [Thore] As mentioned before we can get some stuff from a shop that closes soon. Who wants to take care of that together with me?
    - [Silvan] I can do
    - Small group talks after CoMe
    - Request for large (stainless steeeeel) sink
- [Janina] How to handle guest requests in the coming weeks and months? I'd like to answer the girl who wrote an email to us recently.
    - Clara and Felix are interested to help making some kind of process proposal.
    - [Doug] Two factors I can think of: Prior risk (How big is the persons social network?) Travel risk (How likely are they to contract on the way?)
- [Anja] How do we want to handle people coming back and going into quarantine? Bodhi/Lise and me might overlap.
    - [Tilmann] Maybe Bodhi and Lise can come here directly if they distance themselve some days before leaving Harzgerode and then camping out on their way some days.
    - [Matthias] We could also try quarantining inside Kanthaus.
    - [Maxime] We do our best to try and protect ourselves, but we shouldn't add too much complexity and stress to you.
    - [Clara] You can still decide after the flat castings are over how comfortable you feel with your exposure to people.
    - [Anja] I wouldn't feel good coming back here just like that.
    - [Matthias] I would think it could be okay since you spend so much time in the garden anyways and apart from that you could stay in the dragon and cloud room for a while. I wouldn't have asked from you to quarantine in the first place, but I'm thankful to you for offering it!
