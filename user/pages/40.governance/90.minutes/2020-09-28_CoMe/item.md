### 3. Shopping plans

### 4. Discussion & Announcements
- [lise] New order of oat-drink in the basement. Infos here: https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1600865185008800
- [doug] Propose people try to get their personal stuff to personal areas **before** power hour & that it is OK to move stuff to Vortex if not :)
- [Antonin] is now renting a garage nearby, stuff can be stored there if need be. There is already one shelf in the garage. If interested, talk to him to figure out how to organize that.
- [Anja] I planted salad and radishes in the beds. Please water them (you cant see them yet ;) but they should not get dry.)
- [Tilmann] corona meeting followup
- [Janina] There's food to be washed!
- [lise] Scissors are gone! 
- [Janina] SWR request: Shall we or not?
- [lise] compost-toilet **not in use**!
- [bodhi] someone borrowing bike, returning it broken (second time)
  - Thore will repair it
  - Doug will talk to someone about it
  - Tilmann will make a label onto the right bike shed: "do not use these bikes without asking responsible person"
- [Larissa] Water leaks into the shed next to the compost
  - Good to know, we'll keep monitoring it!
- [Doug] Proposal: Let's remove the 'someone is sleeping here' signs in elephant room and intermediate storage
  - It's shouldn't be about preventing people to use the room during the time someone sleeps there, but it's good to know if a bed is already in use in case I also want to use it.
  - Doug will replace the signs.
