<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning
- Please eat all the ready-made leftovers on the stove, before making more food!
- Festival food - fruits, veggies!!
- There's Sauerkraut in the making, which should be moved into the basement in 2-3 days (Michal will remind people, Bodhi is also taking responsibility)
- Boiled cabbage in the basement and raw, cut cabbage and other veggies in the fridge
- Tons of puddings and yoghurts in the basement -> keep the pudding containers (only the nicely shaped ones) for Silvan!
- A bucket full of industrially made cheese sauce (that does not taste like cheese) (One week and it will be trashed for SURE!), a bucket of mayonnaise and don't forget about the 2 buckets of mustard. In the cellar. Move to smaller containers when open.
- Don't open a new milk, find the open one first!
- Food for foodsharing? Maybe Chrisi will take care of it. Bodhi will help with deciding which food to give away.
- Chopping bananas: (James, Chrisi, Mikel) for ice-cream, yay!
- Dumpster diving for fruits and veggies, Matthias, Michal.
- James is motivated to cook someday with someone.
- James is motivated to go dumpster-diving someday with someone.
- Matthias would enjoy to cook on Sunday with no one.
- Bodhi would like to cook at some point with no one.

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)

- How to recognize Einwegpfand (superquick ws by Bodhi) (Look for the pfand logo at a beer can and store. Otherwise put to the yellow recycling bag.)
- Task: Return pfand (Bodhi will do it sometime this week, James and Michal are interested in joining in) sort, load to a car, move to a supermarket, get the money
- On Monday (20-08-18) we took what seems to be the last full gas bottle from the storage in K20.0.the-room-with-grill. Plan to buy some? (Will be combined with returning the Pfand. While being at the gas station the car can get more gas as well.)
- Reskip/rest waste situation. There is a bucket marked with RESKIP in the basement. Put there old cooked food, bread, meat, any organic waste that doesn't go to compost. It will be returned to supermarket dumpster then. Bread can go back to Aldi and not be mixed with the other.
- No popcorn in the communal sleeping room, please! If you want to have the full cinema experience, go to the piano room to watch a movie while eating popcorn. (Janina, Tilmann, Matthias, Bodhi)
- Matthias has a point about keeping high hygiene standards in sleeping rooms including private sleeping rooms.
- A nice laugh about rollmops and spoken language.
- Possible reappearance of wound infection. Refill the disinfectant on toilets, infected people should sleep in separate, own bed. We'll get updated if the alert is valid.
