### 3. Shopping plans
- Luftdruck-Pistole (<10€): Tilmann asks his parents

### 4. Discussion & Announcements
- [Doug] Re announcement: Window paint dry, window putty soft.
- [Nathalie] Team Mika: Who is in? Let's meet!
    - Larissa and Thore are in!
    - There will be a small group meeting with Janina/Tilmann on Tuesday
- [Nathalie] Open Tuesday next weeks. I would recommend to schedule in advance and approach external people. Do it now or in an extra session? Alternative: summer break?
    - ask Unkraut/Klugis/Lea, make a dudle
- [Nathalie] schedule Bauwoche
    - 17.7.- 23.7.
    - Should we invite external people?
    - Maybe not, because it's difficult to coordinate already...
    - Also, if it's not tear-down work then training people is required and that is a limiting factor.
- [Larissa] There will be a EG (Ende Gelände)-Action on Tuesday in Dresden, because the Landtag there will discuss the coal-exit strategy and the future of some villages in the coal area. The train leaves at 11h at Leipzig Hbf. Who would be interessted in going?
    - Argh! Too much happening already!
- [Janina] announcement: apart from the small ring ceremony there will be no extra wedding activities planned/pushed by me! i'm happy if other people make things happen but i don't expect anything. :)
- [Tilmann] trailer to Harzgerode? / how much food to HZ
    - Bodhi has a lot of stuff in mind that should go there, so yes, the trailer will go.
    - maybe half of our oatmilk, potatoes, all remaining veggies/fruit
