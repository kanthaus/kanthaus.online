### 3. Shopping plans
- [Doug] 4 * Stainless steel sink-sieves (Abflusssiebe), €2.50. The plastic ones are hard to clean, and I seem to do it a lot ;p We could get from [DM](https://www.dm.de/profissimo-abfluss-siebe-p4010355673312.html) with Lise's vouchers.
  - [Lise] I don't have dm vouchers...not that I know of. Maybe you meant the one from rhg Anja got?
- [Silvan] Plumbing stuff? There is an unfinished list to which you can still add! Sometime in the next weeks we will order things.

### 4. Discussion & Announcements
- [Tilmann] Announcement: MCM will be on September 30th; review/retrospective next week
- [Tilmann] Announcement: I'm organizing attic VIP small group actions for 1-2 people, today afternoon and tomorrow morning, ~4 hours each.
  - Today with Matthias
  - Tomorrow with Doug
- [Thore] Discussion: Corona framework as a part of CoMe: I had the feeling that it doesn't work very well. Thats why I added the section corona framework in the last week review. What do you think about it and should we delete the points after CoMe or is it okay to upload them on our website? If not I would suggest to copy them in our corona pad.
  - Section appreciated, display on the website seems okay
  - New task for CoMe facilitator: Count points before meeting and put them in the CoMe pad
- [Doug] Foot towel for shower: I recommend hanging it **on the radiator**, or failing that, on the chair. Hanging it on the bath tub gets it wet from the shower curtain + it dries slower (less ventilation)
- [Doug] Bikes: I suggest we make a good order for bikes in the sheds and stick to it! I.e. put the bike back on the hook where you took it from.
  - Order is generally appreciated
  - Doesn't fit spacewise yet so we need to remove some bikes
  - Visitor bikes don't really have space either, maybe the wood shed would be an appropriate spot for 1-2 nights..?
- [Janina] Lunch team: Who is in?
  - Thore, Nathalie, Tilmann, Janina, Larissa
  - Doug asks if it's possible to get lunch one day if one volunteers for cleaning up everything afterwards?
      - Sounds reasonable.
- [Silvan] CoMe Protocol last week?
  - Sadly it's permanently lost :(
  - It was due to a broken script and won't happen again.
- [Silvan] VHS today, who would join?
- [Silvan] K18 updates? How to go on when Anja is not here?
  - Ping her nicely and hope she finds the time to call.
- [Matthias] Solar power update
