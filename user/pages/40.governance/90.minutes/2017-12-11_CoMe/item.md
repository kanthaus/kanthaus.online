### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc)
- Info: Doug can bring lots of bread, cooked potatoes, wurst, etc from Chemnitz Christmas market: let him know today.
- Question: Who is able and willing to drive the transporter in general? (Doug)
- Proposal: If people anticipate hunger and no one is willing to cycle, do not discourage them from driving. (Doug)
- Proposal: Schedule evaluation sessions at coordination meetings. (I wasn't able to do it last week, apologies. Doug)
- Thought: The following three questions have been quite interesting for me these past weeks. I would be interested to talk with people about these questions and similar ones in any form/at in the future (Doug)
  - Do I do anything I don't want to? If yes, what and why?
  - Is there something I want to happen that I don't make happen? If yes, what and why?
  - What is my preferred way to receive critical feedback?
- Info: Doug visited the Bonobo crew (prev. hb6) in Chemnitz. Would be interesting to share with this proto-project: http://gobonobo.blogsport.eu/finanzierung/direktkredite/
- Heating situation/which rooms to continue to heat? Temperatures?

    Currently the heating works from 6am to 8:30pm. If it's freezing during the night it wil automatically switch on again.

    Matthias doesn't have special requirements for heating anymore. The temperature difference in one floor shouldn't be big - not more than 5 degrees, if doors are not kept shut.

    When fewer people are there the ones that are left should decide which rooms to heat and which not.

- Foodsharing at Christmas Market: We didn't say we will come everyday, we only got something from the Langos in front of the stage before. Most of them were very cooperative but seeming as if they usually don't have anything. If people are motivated they can go (around 7-8pm, always dependins) and ask but if not that's also okay. The most important pick-up will be on the very last day, which is Sunday the 17th.
- Foodsharing coops: Postponed until next week or later.
