    - Next Wednesday at 10:00
    - Doug is going to do it
- [Silvan] TV in hipster room: mount to wall and put a cloth over it? (spend money for a mount?)
    - Michal put it down because he doesn't like sleeping facing a screen - a cover would just make this a little better
    - Matthias points out that the window holder needs repositioning if we mount it. Doug can have a look.
    - A good cover solution can be presented.

    - There is a physical list in which people can write down their wishes and ideas.
    - Yoga room team will talk about potential meeting directly after come.
- [Larissa] new Years Comitee - who is interested?
    - Zui is.
- [Tilmann] mold treatment in piano room and bathroom windows - I sprayed H2O2 on it this morning and it reacted a lot. would make sense to limepaint soon, to prevent further growth.
    - lime is in a big bag in the attic, there might be some premix in the basement in a blue container.
    - Thore and Nathalie also discovered mold on the mattress in the cave. They will wash the mattress cover today and maybe put some peroxide on the mattress additionally.

  - [Tilmann] he said he's in official quarantine right now and can't come back.

    - He might pick some up and bring them.
