### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [janina] Shall we keep the dinner lottery?
    - no resistance, let's continue
    - opt-out seems acceptable
    - for this week, we just do it spontaneously and check next week
- [matthias] WuppHour formalization
    - proposal to have 2 core hours (10-12) and two hours of 'non-scheduling' afterwards
    - Matthias felt wupphours time was not respected with lunch at 13:30
- [matthias] Sticking to schedules and allowing others to do that as well
    - Resistance to legislating breaks
    - Simple communication would have been OK
    - General point to not overlap and leave 'breathing space' between events
    - to have registration of interest
- [janina] roadmap is about to end: next week on Friday is the 1st of March! (Just a reminder)
- [janina] month is about to end: I'd like to have a projects update thingy next week. Possible?
    - [Doug] how about having personal project updates on non roadmap months?
    - [lise] yay makes sense :)
    - [nick] plug to progress https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-public/issues/141
- [matthias] UndJetzt2019 request + utopival request
    - no general resistance against hosting both
    - so we describe the sitation to both groups and accept them
- [lise] Email: Projekt des Freundeskreis Museum Wurzen
    - [lise] its a weekend around easter, where some houses in wurzen open their doors, telling people who lived there, etc. or just having info in front of the house.
    - [doug] see kanthaus-mails
- [tilmann] brown bin is almost full, when is next emptying?
    - [matthias] likely thursday in a week (28.2.), interpolated from the waste calendar sheet going until 2019-01-31
