### 4. Discussion & Announcements
#### Round 1
- [Doug] printer doesn't sleep! How can we help it?
    - [maxime] somehow, following several failed attempts to get to sleep on Sunday, it got to sleep at 15:10. Hypothesis:
        - it could be due to the fact that several people went out walking some 20 min before that, thus possibly not having network interactions with the printer?
        - it could be due to the fact that at about the same time people went walking, I clicked on the "on" button (tried to look at settings without finding anything to change), then clicked on the "off" button (NOT the power switch)
    - [maxime again]: the printer seems to have spontaneously got out of sleep Sunday around 23:10 : any device that got up at that time?
    - [matthias] I'm aware of this problem, did investigate already and feel responsible. It wakes up whenever it receives any network packet.
- [Janina] [request for Lantern](https://codi.kanthaus.online/birthRoomRequest?view)
- [zui] bildungskollektiv woche, friends of zui
    - would like to plan this, didn't get much feedback so far
    - general feeling in terms of fullness of house: no resistance, some support, some undecidedness
    - topic will be brought up again in corona meeting to talk about points and risks
- [lise] freezing grains?
    - grains are now in buckets and if people want to freeze the grains to kill off potential bug eggs or the likes, they can.
    - lise is unsure if it's really necessary since we'll probably consume the grains quite soon anyway, but if people want to take action it won't harm

#### Round 2
- [Janina] There is a (pad for Christmas orga)[https://codi.kanthaus.online/christmasOrga?edit], please participate if you have things in mind that you'd like to do!
- [Thore] Coffee drinkers: please always clean the french press after use otherwise there might be mold!
