### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- in K20-0# there was two times the toilet-paper empty and the last person didnt refill it.. Only stupid toilet-paper-users here :( - Renewed awareness, include in the house tour and more witch-hunting should be an appropriate solution.
- Bufdi meeting outcome presentation and proposal announcement to be decided probably at the coming CoMe so people have time to think about it (Bodhi, Matthias, Laurina) - Look into Slack for more details.
- The feature by Jörg Wunderlich is in production now! :-) who would go on June 30? - Still unclarity about what exactly is the event. Janina and Matthias are generally interested. We wait for more info from Jörg.
- Kanthaus blog presentation of what is there and proposal (Janina and Laurina) - Weekly posts are the goal! The content can range from explanations of how to build things, documentation of projects, cooking, foodsaving, gardening to nice and pleasant slice-of-life pieces. The more Kanthausers participate the better!
- Vika/Guido-situation from the weekend: update and proposal for collective agreements - Ongoing talk in #kanthaus-governance, a general meeting about stranger responsibility and related topics will follow next week.
- Benji will spend quite some time (120h) here wanting to do productive work. Ideas? - Matthias, Tilmann and Bodhi will discuss the hipster room possibilities directly after this meeting.
- Planning for the next foodsharing.de hackweek should start soon. Then we can get funding for it again, maybe? - More about this next week.
- Do we want to schedule a meeting for me to tell people about how things have played out with the Noomap team. It is a bit involved and I only want to explain this once. (Adam) - Yep, on Friday.
- For your Information - at 1pm I will be having a call with British-Asian investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed which is exciting! (Adam)
