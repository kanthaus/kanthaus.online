### 3. Shopping plans

### 4. Discussion & Announcements
#### Round 1
- [antonin] I would like to do fiberglass reinforcements on the velomobile in the workshop in the coming days. The velomobile would need to stay at least 24 hours in the room, which should be heated during that time. Happy to schedule it so that it avoids conflicts with other uses of the workshop (people should still be able to come in - space is just going to be a bit scarce).
    - Could freeshop be an alternative?
    - Concern that fumes might harm the clothes in there.
    - One day in the workshop should be fine...
    - Workshop users will coordinate between themselves and post on Slack
- [chandi] Proposal phase for BubiTwo's Name ends in 2 hours!! https://ukuvota.world/#/app/45d5cde6-af4a-03b0-d8e8-c759f1e63235/collect
- [matthias] Internet infrastructure upgrade: Adding a "proper" firewall device for stability & performance improvements & easier administration. Internet disruption for 15 minutes, printing & server access disruption for 1 hour. When can I do this?
    - scheduled for friday between 8 and 10:30 am.

#### Round 2
- [matthias] Germany wide lockdown from Wednesday (https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/corona-regeln-lockdown-101.html)
- [Nathalie] Team weekend reminder
- [Silvan] MoI vote restart?
    - yes please!
    - bodhi and maxime will take care and then have it run until the evening
    - after that the vote will be binding and we'll know the date
