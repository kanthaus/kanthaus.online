_to be scheduled:_
(*when possible, avoid scheduling events at times that would conflict with being part of the cooking team: 17:00->19:00*)
- Knowledge Sharing proposals:
  * [?] How to legally download movies
  * [chandi] Ansible for nice and easy reproducible server setups

### 3. Shopping plans
* [matthias] servo to play around with automating ventilation: 4 servos for 16,50€ (https://www.ebay.de/itm/4x-Digital-Metall-Gear-RC-MG996R-Lenk-Servo-55g-15Kg-Upgrade-RC-Neu/202535218467)
* [matthias] vacuum cleaner hose? (discussion?) a) for doing the work in the attic b) can be used as replacement or where we need a longer hose... Different qualities from 2,5€/m to 8€/m; diameter would need to be figured out by looking at current vacuum cleaners, likely 32 or 35mm ID. Also, we might need to add 1 or 2 connecting pieces (~10 euros each)
  * https://www.ebay.de/itm/Staubsauger-Reparaturschlauch-Saugschlauch-Staubsaugerschlauch-Meterware-32-mm/312169603295 (2,80€/m) (seems quite "normal", would think it's worse than our current miele ones)
  * https://www.valekna.de/eva-373-as-35mm-laenge-meterware (7,73€/m) (seems a bit normal/special but also heavy duty, dunno about quality/flexibilty)
  * https://www.valekna.de/iduflex-pvc-35mm-10m (6,20€/m or 56€ for 10m) (seems quite special and very heavy duty, wonder why it is not used more often as vacuum cleaner hose, would like to try)
  

### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
* [matthias] door closer evaluation: https://codi.kanthaus.online/doorcloser-evaluation
* [Doug] Please only new, completely flat and undamaged paper in printer! (Put everything else in 'Scrap paper', paper jams defeat any ecological intentions)
* [zui for chandi] Elena wants to visit asking if it's not to full?
* [zui] handeling of visitors during full house times besides corona points (I also have friends that are interested of visiting and never know what to tell them)
  * In general: Notice to kh vol mem 48h before
* [Bodhi] food washig/sorting: bodhi feels responsible for keeping overview, prioritizing washing order and sorting the stuff in the storages in the end. Dragon room set up as temporary sorting room for clean food (and for cleaning almost clean food with a cloth). Very happy for help washing and sorting!
* [Nathalie] I take care of the christmas tree, I'd bring it to the Wurzen Christmastree collecting point
* [Bodhi] a lot of christmas decoration in the elephant room is a bit annoying
  * [Lise] I would throw it away today
  * [Nathalie] I would tear down the adventcalendar today, people please take the cards away.
#### Round 2
* [zui] MOI prep time
  * there is a pad now: https://codi.kanthaus.online/monthOfIntrospection_2021#
* [matthias] mold and wetness in the dumpster kitchen
  * Try to keep floor less wet
  * Doing a wallpaper-removal-lime-paint action
  * Reinstalling the heater
  * Dishwasher there is leaking a bit of water when operated as well
* [matthias] What's with the waste inside the KMW?
  * Bringing it away this week. Doug & Antonin & Larissa offer help but not driving; Nathalie can imagine driving; Bodhi & Nathalie would like to spontaneously join
  * Suggestion for it happening tomorrow morning.
* [silvan] Golf stay here at time when i am not here?
  * No, might get it if needed but maybe don't need it. Thanks for asking though :-)
