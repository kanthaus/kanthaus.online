### 3. Announcements
- [Janina] I found the door to the food storage open many times last week - please take better care to keep it closed!
  - [Doug] I noticed that too and wondered if the situation had changed. What is the reasoning for keeping it closed actually? (I thought food should be well enough packaged it doesn't matter.)
- [Doug] 2 minute `Kanthaus` outage at 18:34 Sunday.
- [Bodhi] 1 box of dumpster washing to be done
- [Bodhi] maybe people want to cook creatively with hummus today :)
- [Lise] Schmiede4 has a building week (13-20.6)! I think it's corona -compatible - http://www.schmiede4.net/?q=node/120

### 4. Shopping plans
 
### 5. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Doug] Proposal: corona whitelist https://codi.kanthaus.online/coronaWhitelist?both# To be adopted if no resistance before Friday.
  - [Thore] Having the framework might make this not necessary anymore - hard for me to say at this point in time what I think
  - [Maxime] Whitelist can be relevant when a second wave is coming as we give the people on there more security
- [Bodhi] lise corona decision
  - Poll has been on Slack
  - long discussion
  - strong resistance of one person for the "no limitations"-option
- Corona Framework meeting
