     - Go for it!


### 4. Discussion & Announcements
 - [Larissa] Fullmoon coming up again! Who would be interested in a bonfire/sauna action at VillaKlug on Monday or Sunday? I would ask them if there is interested from KH-people :)
     - Larissa will ask the Klugis and let us know if/what happens.
 - [lise] i didnt manage to put up the Adventcalendar. It would be great if someone could do it. Next week we can open the first door alreday ;)
     - [larissa + nathalie] already put it up above the dining room table!
     - now it's waiting to be filled with nice surprises! :)
     - [janina] suggests to add performance-like things (people reading out stuff, acting…)
 - [Matthias] I posted in Slack about getting more big duvets (https://yunity.slack.com/archives/G8JTYBZFD/p1605771669001000?thread_ts=1605771310.000900&cid=G8JTYBZFD). I would offer caring to get/buy more comfort size duvets if wanted to improve the situation for everyone. Currently, we would have 2 thick and 2 normal comfort size duvets (+1 feather). Ideally, there would be one in each "private" + 2-3 in communal + ?? (e.g. dorm), which means there should be 9+, so at least 4 more. Please discuss in Slack :-)
     - [Nathalie] How is the general process of changing to winter duvets?
     - [Janina] Bodhi was taking care of this but we need a process for this
     - Some support and no resistance to Matthias buying blankets
- [lise] grain & flour delivery coming on thursday (26.11.)
    - [doug] how to store it? Will ask on Slack
- [janina] Announcement: Tilmann and I will not sleep in the sleep kitchen for the whole week - _the_ opportunity to try and spend the night with Mika! ;)
- [zui] Rooftop: there will be work on Wednesday to put the tiles on, we will need many people then. The work is mostly about standing in line and passing tiles through. Meet at 10:00 to coordinate.
- [janina] Request from NDK (Netzwerk für Demokratische Kultur). They'd like us to contribute a panel in an online format next Saturday. It would be 45 minutes and about sharing and how to actually _do_ it. Anybody interested/available? The event is happening from 11:00 to 15:00.
  - Janina will write again and ask for more details, then make a post.
  - Slight interest from zui, larissa and janina.
- [janina] there is quite some food in the dumpster kitchen!
- [Doug] tip/gift for delivery people? (specifically around the end of the year)
  - [janina] support, perhaps cookies?
  - [nathalie] generally interested, around Nikolaus
