### 4. Discussion & Announcements

- [Janina] Proposal for sleeping spot management
    - Use Karrot instead of reservation sheets between 9 pm and 9 am
    - There is a group in which all rooms are set up as 'pickups': https://karrot.world/#/group/114/
    - [tbr?] More details on the proposal: https://codi.kanthaus.online/sleepingOrga
      - [tbr?] there is a password for the karrot account written in the pad which is publically linked on the website when CoMe is published
    - I'll host a knowledge sharing today to show Karrot in more detail
    - Let's try it out this week and see how it goes! :)
    - concerns: only available online. could be difficult for visitors / add some barriers 
    - [nathalie] proposal for offline: sign up on karrot and nathalie transfers the online reservation on sheets to have the sheets still updated. only for nighttime. than we could see the reserved plaes without needing to sign up
    - users of dorm [maxime, antonin] would not like to have added work because its already working quite good offline.
    - janina will still do the knowledge session
    - small group will work on a proposal for an offline board [talita, michal]
    - decision postponed
- [Bodhi] Idea to have potatoe and carrot washing as a power hour task (also instead of the sorting) 
    - great, will be added to the board
- [lise] who is cleaning dust-masks? is there a responsible person...doug? Could that become a power hour task?
    - Doug feels responsible for the masks and his happy to show cleaning
    - if you feel resistance while breathing or its smelling, filter can be changed --> talk to doug!
    - cleaning needs to be done carefully. normally its enough to just wipe out with a dry cloth. 
- [Tilmann] Idea to start looking for second-hand doors for elephant room breakthrough
    - people could already think where the door can be and paint the frame on the wall
    - is somebody motivated to look for a door? 
    - Maybe somebody wants to set up a slack-bot for monitoring offers!?
        - Chandi will do a skillshare on how to set it up (next week)
- [chandi] Anti-DDT paint pick up in Berlin-Lichtenberg (East)? (An offer for 55€ instead of 280€) Any friends who could do it?
    - located in east of berlin (people will ask their friends)
    - needs to be picked up until wednesday
    - it's enough paint for all the Kehlbalken (collar beams)
- [Bodhi] Leipzig tour tomorrow to pick up carpets and go to ZAW Cröbern
- [janina] midwife visit
    - intro-meeting about homebirth this friday
    - if people are interested and will be here during the potential birth time *and* are willing to help during birth, they can come
- [doug] the market pick up is often done alone by Lea. Maybe we can also take care of that or join her
