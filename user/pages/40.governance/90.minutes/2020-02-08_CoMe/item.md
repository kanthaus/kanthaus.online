### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Silvan] Acrolotl 20./21.2. online - Headquater KH? Maike and Nina would come here for this. (use Yoga-room and hipster the whole time, need heating in yogaroom)
    - Silvan will look for other places to go, because it might be really full in KH which is a strong concern (resistance?)
- [Doug] CoMe minutes, digital calendar, evaluation records... please do these same day! Some people 'depend' on them (like me).
- [Janina] Sugar intake reduction challenge over all of WoI
    - Please don't offer us chocolate! :)

#### Round 2
- [Silvan] There are to less Schleckregal-shelves, is someone motivated to install one/two more?
    - chandi tries to remove the buckets from the lower levels in the shelve
- [Doug] I am quite unhappy about empty Teekannen being left out. Please empty, rinse and put on shelf. If lazy/busy, put on 'dishwasher shelf'. Please also help me enforce this, i.e. telling others if you see them doing this.
- [Antonin] Do we wan't more ceiling clothes drying racks?
    - maybe in the lower staircase?
