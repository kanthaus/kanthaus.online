### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Message by Findus via slack: hey Olli, who is coming to the lu meeting wants to know if he can bring his little well behaved dog? also: Would it be ok, if some of us stay till monday/tuesday?-> Matthias answered privately that the dog is likely not a problem but will check today. 
 -> OK. So it is likely, that ~10 people from LU will stay for some more days. Dog is okay, we want to get cleareron dog rules and communicate them more clearly.
- Check-in round before come / all meetings? -> No real consensus; just try it out at next CoMe; People are encouraged to come to next CoMe at 9.50 and we start with a very short personal sharing round, regular CoMe then at 10.00.
- Garden: Idea with isabell/laurina/matthias to make the area around the cherry trees more grassy-usable. For that, would remove some more trees/bushes; want to build a hedge towards sven or leave it open?
 -> Fine to do that. Please don't cut down anything big and think before cutting. Decide yourself where you want replant them :-) Hedge vs no hedge had no strong opinions.
We are out of toilet paper (Adam will get some)
-> Isabell suggested to buy recycled toilet paper as it is cheaper as well as more environmentally friendly
- Adam is inventorizing our medicine cabinet currently. There will be a list accessible on air-table. He suggests using plastic bags for sorting/storage and asks about other opinions. -> Temporarily do it like that, we are free to redo it at another time differently.
- There is hot water in the snack kitchen and the upper bathroom heated from solar power now. Its not extensive but enough especially on sunny days.
