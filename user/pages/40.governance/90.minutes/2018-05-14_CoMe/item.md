### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Task: 2 coats of white paint on window frame, any takers? -> maybe combine with other windows that need it?
- Request: calendar users please include link or brief description for events. (Doug)
- Question: when is the 1st Kanthaus Birthday? First residence record was on 2017-07-19, association of formal Kanthaus community 2017-08-05. (Doug)
  - We got keys on 2018-07-12, everyone happy with this date.
- Proposal: set up sharing event defaults
  - Default time: 17:00 - 18:00, Wednesdays. (Reasoning: far enough from Monday for reflection, doesn't clash with Landgut Nemt or regular events, allows 'community week' to end after the power hour)
  - Default room: cloud room. (Reasoning: comfy, calm)
  - Default format:
    - 2-3 minutes silence
    - one round where people briefly share just their emotions (e.g. with explicit words, or metaphors: not reasons, solutions, etc)
    - 'open' circle until time runs out
  - Default norms:
    - If you're late and the door is closed, the group have started. Please don't disturb them, come earlier next time!
    - Please leave your phone outside.
    - You can bring your own cup of tea or glass of water, but please don't bring food.
    - Find facilitator at Come if possible.
- Stasi bunker in Machern can be visited any last weekend in the month (5/4€) (matthias) -> can be visited during the rotterparty for free
- Plan the financial meeting (8 hours -> 1/2 days) (Matthias)
- Kollektivhaus information round (Matthias)
- Look again at the spring roadmap meeting minutes (Tilmann)
- Adam requests help to complete the medicine inventory by including what the medicines are for, requests help of a German speaker. Some concerned that system is too complex. Adam happy to continue.
- Isabel wants to make sure people are not using the communal closet as a freeshop. Topic for the tour, Isabel will make initial sign.
- Janina has sorted socks into the size categories!
