### 3. Shopping plans
- [Doug] 100m * 3mm braided hemp cord (geflochtenes Hanfseil) [27.90€](https://www.ebay.de/itm/Hanfseil-HEMPBRAID-geflochten-Hanf-Naturhanf-Seil-Schnur-Kordel-Leine/143560149642) (asked for sample, no one had resistance, I'm happy to half-subsidise)
  - Getting sample soon
- [Doug] a5 paper blocks. I will buy for myself—do we want some for house? Do individuals want?
  - Apparently not
- [Antonin] more rye grains? We only have 5 buckets left and we eat a lot of bread. The Rollemühle order has not been placed yet so it could be worth bundling that up? I would propose to buy 25kg
  - no resistance 

### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Tilmann] ukuvote about K22 chimney - proposal period until after CoMe, then voting for 3 days: https://ukuvota.world/#/app/29dc379f-362f-b872-9548-6f41795d51a8/collect
- [maxime] pool: how often do people print stuff? The printer was turned off during the last days, nobody seemed bothered, could that be the default state, at least until the sleep bug is addressed?
    - short survey, most people print 1-2 times per week, 
    - idea is fitting to working hours
    - seems fine to turn off the printer during night
    - printer takes about 5min to warm up and start
- [nathalie] prep-week starting this friday - seems fine
- [chandi] Reserving the cave: from now on until We, 13:00 (for a conference)
    - ok
    - cave is a good retreat space also for quarantine
- [Doug] Vortex: catch up or leave?
    - leave!


#### Round 2
- [Doug] lower staircase toilet fixed?
  - apparently not
  - advice not to use it
- [maxime] dinner lottery with memory: should the dinner lottery try to not generate the same pairs from one week to another? It's doable but there is a cost in complexity for maintainers and CoMe facilitators
  - CoMe facilitation is already complex
  - concerns are shared, would be a funny feature if optional
  - is this a feature without a user? most people find it funny to cook with the same person
  - people can activly volunteer to cook together
  - chandi and Maxime look at the code
  - feature request: third person for dish washing
  - there could be a session on this
  - Where is the difference to food washing etc.?
 - [Matthias] People need to repark the car!
   - chandi and Nathalie will take care
 - [maxime] there is still food to wash
 - [Doug] In the sinks: put the sieves back and take care that its properly adjusted
     - also in the bath-room
