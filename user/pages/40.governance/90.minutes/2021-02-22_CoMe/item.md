- [Tilmann/Matthias] plumbing stuff
- [Antonin] roof tiles for 200‚Ç¨ -> small group discussion after come got mandate to decide

### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Janina] a new round of thinking about the constitution started and its not too late to [join in](https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1613473674279400)! its a phase of working independently or in small groups and on Tuesday 2nd at 3:30 there will be a BBB to bring together ideas and proposals.
    - proposals should be detailed and maybe people can do a temperature check, so after the BBB there could be an ukuvote with already well figured out proposals
- [Doug] Migrating kanthaus.online from Github + Travis ‚Üí Gitlab. 1 less account for kanthausians, all git in one place, hopefully faster build. Antonin <s>hopefully</s> to help translate CI - any other help/advice?
    - people are waving hands
- [Matthias] Ventilating/Windows/Heating: It is still winter and partially cold! Leaving windows open in heated rooms does not make sense. Please only ventilate shortly! Please don't turn off radiators in rooms where they are used for mold prevention: Snack Kitchen/Kitchen/Elephant room
    - It's still warmer outside than inside, especially in heated rooms
    - If rooms are warm, the heating won't do anything. So please just keep the radiators staying on (especially both kitchens & elephant room)
    - Keep on ventilating until we've reached summer for sure :) Stay strong!
- [Thore] oat milk is empty. I already opened the remaining ones from the storage and if they're empty i want to buy it. 
    - buy vegan oat animals, feed them in the garden and milk them :P 
    - Stay strong everyone
    - Thore is managing the crisis - phew!
- [Lise] Extension of me using the Cave. How do people feel about extending the period until the 18.03.21? 
    - Would be nice to have more time to rearrange the room, etc.
    - if concerns, i can set up an ukuvota
    - no concerns, but ask for concerns again once online to notify those who weren't at CoMe

#### Round 2
- [Doug] Kitchen sink. For a while I've wanted to get a gastro, edelstahl one. I would like to gather requirements, and get a 'green light' to go ahead when I get time. Current sink diameter ~30cm long * 40cm wide * 20cm deep. I'm thinking of something like this https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/spuele-edelstahl-2-becken-links-150-x-60-edelstahltisch/1318954626-86-2231 or this https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/edelstahl-spuele-2-becken-ablage-rechts-150-x-60/984586979-176-2231
    - discussion in #kanthaus-stuff
    - hurry to the next topic, we dont have time!
- [Janina] ukuvota about purpose of the sleep kitchen: proposal phase ends tonight
- Antonin's roof work availability poll also awaits more participation!
- [Lise] How did people like CoMe in the piano room?
    - people waving hands high to middle, maybe more discussion in slack or next CoMe
- [Silvan] how to continue with the K18?
    - find out after the next MCM
- a discussion about extending the lottery for doing dishes would be great
    - for testing assigning people Thore will hang up a sheet where people can write them down 
- [Tilmann] MiKa is happy for caretakers this week, the sheet is hanging in the dining room
