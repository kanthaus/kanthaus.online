### 3. Shopping plans


### 4. Discussion & Announcements
- [Anja] Thursday 9:30am people from the Diakonie come and visit to talk about the Gardenproject. Since I thought there is the power hour happening, I didn't invite them in the house/to give a house tour. But maybe that's possible and nice now? Thoughts?
- [Anja] tonight: Sock sorting party with cake ONLY for participants ^^
- [Janina] Felix who wrote an email to us some days ago wants to come by with some people to get to know our project. I'd like to offer him a distanced chat in the garden on Saturday, any resistance or support?
- [Silvan] What do you think about the toilet hose of upper staircase toilet? I Would like to install more of them on other toilets.
  - Go ahead with 2 more
- [Silvan] What is the status of the Komposttoilet? Why does it smell so much?
  - [matthias] Fan blocked, I turned it off yesterday
  - [doug] will fix sign & talk to bodhi
- [Matthias] KMW glass repairs
  - Let's have it done by a company
- [Tilmann] future KMW parking spot
  - [janina] will check out available parking lots
- [Doug] Can we mark the pillow cases with sizes as well?
  - [Larissa] I'll try
- [Doug] One speaker in the communal is not working
  - [Matthias] Did a quick cabling check which looked alright - also the subwoofer plays the sound from the missing channel so it can only be amplifier/cabling/speaker. I value the speakers, so before you try opening them (if necessary) please ask me!
- [Larissa] Please use the toilet brush if it is dirty
- [Nathalie] Keep Kanthaus clear
- [Doug] I notice a lot of things being moved a bit closer to where they belong but not finally there. Don't know if it annoys me.
- [Janina] Please keep the garden doors closed when it's warm outside
- [Tilmann] Are you interested in getting automated updates on our bank account every Sunday? Tell me and I'll add you to some special (private) Slack channels
- [Matthias] dragon room usage
