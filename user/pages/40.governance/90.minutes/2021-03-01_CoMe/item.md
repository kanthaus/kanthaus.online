### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Silvan] Process of registering asociations at KH address? Feuerqualle?
    - has it happened already? should be announced and discussed in CoMe
    - what does it mean to register an association here? legal consequences? -> Amtsgericht/Finanzamt responsible
    - reasons for Kanthaus: other founding members don't know how long they will stay at their place
    - no resistance, but time until tuesday midnight to get more information and raise concerns
- [Larissa] Sunday will be the Founding of the FeuerQualle e.V. and we would be happy if some of you would like to be founding members! I can post the Satzung for you to read in slack, if you're interested :) 
    - Session on sunday at 15:00
- [lise] No concerns raised for extending the agreement regarding The Cave until 18.03.21. I guess its decided then^^
  - [chandi] I think it would be nice to have the agreement printed on the door. As far as I know, it is currently only accessable in #kh_vol_and_mem, so not possible to read for some residents
  - janina will do it
- [Matthias] KMW leaving to HZ
    - bring some drinks and joghurt on the way back
    - some repairs need to be done, best would be to do it in Harzgerode
    - when? Matthias talks to Antonin, decides afterwards
- [Doug] There are new name labels! Please name spaces you personalize. Again, please don't use masking tape long term. Also: please reevaluate where and how you keep your stuff, there isn't a lot right now, and I think it is the reponsibility of the people with most to minimize/compress their stuff for those with least...
    -  new labels are on boxes in K20-2, shoe holders, boxes in K20 staircase
    -  pens missing in some places
- [Tilmann] Heatpump opinion ukuvote to happen soon! Matthias and me will publish a written proposal right after CoMe. Voting to start on Friday, going for one week. We are mostly interested if people are happy for us to work out all the details for replacing our gas heater with a heat pump this year.
    - informal voting party on friday to ask questions?
    - share more information about connection to attic works
    - human ressources considered? also written in the proposal

<!-- pause for people who haven't spoken, to think about whether they have a point -->

#### Round 2
- [tilmann] let's try out a Mika care team that casually meets Monday 13:00 in the to dining room to organize care times for the week - who would be in?
    - kito is interested
- [Doug] All (new) Neuland marker pens are really easily refillable and one can buy replacement tips. I recommend only buying them from now on. Research here: https://codi.kanthaus.online/markers?edit, Nathalie wants to write them to see if we can get left overs for free
- [Silvan] more bidets? 
    -  no strong opinions, but slight resistance
- [Matthias] Bodhi & Lise discovered mold on the mattress in hipster room...
    - reminder to ventilate and let matresses breathe, would be nice to look after it and take care
- [Tilmann] JaTiLe would continue using the Free Shop for sleeping for this week - any feedback?
    - thanks for asking
    - Janina will update the sign (closed because of corona)
- [Matthias] Fridge: Keep or revert? (new one is properly cool, uses 30-40% less energy still, but much smaller/more unorderly)
  - [matthias] Would offer to put a self-build shelf of ~60cm height underneath; should I? - sounds good!
  - get a second one to get a nicer order? maybe energywise better to have a bigger one
  - old one moves to basement and goes to sleep there
