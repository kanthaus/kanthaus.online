    - let's start at 9 am, but people can also join in later
  - Who would be up for next week?
    - looks like that's also gonna work, great! :D
- Stuff (Bodhi, Matthias, Thore, Chandi):
  - K20 basement got cleared out from useless stuff, Pfand got brought away
    - windows from the attic got sorted into those we want to keep (moved to the basement) and those we don't (will be gotten rid of)
- Rooms (Nathalie, Janina):
  - [Bodhi] Workshop: more stuff ordered, clean working clothes now in cupboard under dirty work clothes (feedback wanted)
  - more stuff coming in today and bigger reorganizing planned. Look through private boxes if possbile.

### 3. Announcements
- [Doug] I changed a bunch of people from gitlab 'owners' to 'maintainers'
- [Matthias] there is the online climate camp from Friday to Sunday.

- [Anja] food to be washed and fruit to be eaten!
- [Bodhi] Siphon in the kitchen is not installed - Maxime and Bodhi take care

### 4. Shopping plans
- [Bodhi] bike bags, second hand or good deal. 2 or 4 bike bags. travelling only? - please write more details on slack and we can decide 
- [Bodhi] yeast flakes, just 2 packs from Kräuterfee - no resistance
- [Bodhi] Schnittschutzhose for chainsaw works (already asked one in L for 15€) - sounds good
- [Matthias] Kassettenabzieher 10€ https://www.bike-components.de/de/ParkTool/Kassettenabzieher-FR-5-2G-p57123/ with the next bike shopping - sounds good
 
### 5. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Doug] Propose we reimburse Lise for the circular saw.
    - Why is this a special item? There are more items in this category.
    - It's good if the circular saw is a Kanthaus item, esp. when Lise doesn't need a private one.
    - If Lise wants money, we could talk about it. 
- [Doug] The unit under the kitchen sink... seems like a downgrade? :sweat_smile: (harder to access bins because of doors/panels, more stuff/more difficult to clean)
    - [Janina] I was very much in favor of it so that Mika won't be able to easily access all the trash when he starts actually crawling. 
    - [Clara] I can also imagine us getting used to it. Lets try it out for another 2 weeks. 
    - [Anja] We could have smaller bags and empty them more often.
    - we will discuss it again in CoMe in 2 weeks
- [Clara] informing findus, michal about passing threshold
    - there a 2 thresholds: Absolute days and Abscence threshold
    - Michal knows
    - Matthias will write findus
- [Janina] We are sleeping in the communal for some days now. Do you hear him in the dorm?
    - Yes, sometimes but its fine.
    - What happens to the family room? Work in progress. People can sleep there but not private.
    - We can put the volume higher in the piano room!
