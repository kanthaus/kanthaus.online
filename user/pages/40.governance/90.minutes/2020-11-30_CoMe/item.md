### 4. Discussion & Announcements
#### Round 1
- [Doug] Sad both Wera bitholders are gone. I'm considering getting a personal one if they don't show up soon. Proposal to always leave them in a drill at end of working sessions.
  - [bodhi] sorry forgot one in my pocket.. its back now. i like the proposal of leaving them in the machine, but it can still happen because people might forget.
- [Janina] I really like communal breakfast, so I'll take care to have something on the table around 9 am. Feel free to participate! :)
- [bodhi] when spontaneous visitors come to the house, please tell them to wear a mask and wash hands at the door
  - [doug] -> corona mtg
- [Anja] I will continue sewing this week. If you have clothes to fix or curtain orders, please tell me asap.
- [Nathalie] I would like to start a christmas committee. Who would like to join? Or is this a possible MCM team?
- [chandi] Since we heat some rooms again, please keep the doors closed :)
  - [Janina] Especially the door from piano room to hallway and all doors to the staircases!
- [Silvan] shoe-money?
  - proposal to lock the back door (and to make more keys for people if necessary)
- [larissa] corona meeting for people leaving for christmas? Proposal to coordinate to avoid high corona point expenditure when people return. See slack.

#### Round 2
- [Nathalie] new sub-group: team weekend! who is in this week? Means: leisure time either alone or communal, short meeting friday at 6pm
- [Doug] Open task: get the right-hand speaker in piano room to work again.
  - [Silvan] could help and also rearrange the cable around the room
- [Anja] lack of space in short term storage. Two boxes seem to be missing and two boxes have no name associated to them.
  - [Janina] it's not really short term anymore
  - [Doug] the space is used by people who also have private storage elsewhere, perhaps they could use that?
