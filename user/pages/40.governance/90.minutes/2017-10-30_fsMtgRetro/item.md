_The Foodsharing Festival Meeting was the first planned event at Kanthaus for an external group. Getting feedback was therefore deemed to be particularly relevant._

===

1. Intro: a brief description of retrospective purpose and theory, a wish for constructive/non-judgemental setting and a reading of 'the Prime Directive'.
2. Planetary orbit game: everyone was first asked to silently select another person, then to circle that person 3 times. Chaos! Fun! Wahh!
3. Triangular graph: three corners of the room were marked as 'Kanthaus', 'Foodsharing Festivals Meeting' and 'Personal/Other.' People were asked to orient themselves in the room according to how much time they felt they spent on those topics.
4. Splitting into small groups: 3 smaller groups were formed by numbering in a spiral from the outside.
5. Individual reflection: everyone was asked to reflect on the questions "What was liked?', 'What wasn't liked?', and 'What would have been liked?' and recorde their answers on paper.
6. Small group reflection: Individuals were invited to discuss similarities and differences between their individual reflections.
7. Reflection summary: everyone re-grouped and then a spokesperson for each group summarised the outstanding points which were–
  - What was liked?
    - The party. The decoration, music and energy.
    - Having AC power the whole time.
    - A friendly and energetic atmosphere.
    - Amazing food and people who make food.
  - What wasn't liked?
    - The back-door to 22 being so often closed and with so few keys.
    - Confusion of sleeping rooms and where people are meant to sleep.
    - Difficult to find peace/focus/do external work.
    - Too much noise in/around sleeping rooms whilst people trying to sleep.
  - What would have been liked?
    - More personal talks.
    - Group walk outside.
    - A bit more structure.
8. Round of appreciation: individuals that wanted to gave appreciation to individuals, events, phenomena, etc.
