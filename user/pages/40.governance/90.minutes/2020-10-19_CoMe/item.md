- [matthias] Coldness & humidity: Please keep doors generally closed except you want it open for some reason (e.g. office door over night: colder in the morning). Keep doors between high humidity/cold regions closed: e.g. kitchen / dining room while cooking; bathroom while showering
  - Last days, I normally find all doors in K20-1 open in the morning.
- [matthias] Heating - does it need discussion? pro/con voices?
    - [doug] would be sad to wait for the last people to feel cold until we start heatin
    - this week will be warmer

    - will be friday at 10:00

    - silvan can imagine to assist
- [maxime] the new water counter in k20-b-6 is partly flooded but seems to work: anyone could feel responsible for checking with the company that changed it recently if that's an acceptable working condition?
    - https://haustechnik-wissen.de/wasserzaehler/
        - "Bei Nassläufern befindet sich der obere Teil der Wasseruhr (Zählwerk, Ziffernblatt,…) unter Wasser, welches als Schmiermittel dient."

  - long term storage in the basement: 10 boxes
  - k20-1 storage (to be eaten next): 1 box
  - k20-0 hallway remaining to be sorted: 30 boxes
  - daily potatoes sorting session: usually around 16:00, jump in!
- [Lise] The swr-people are coming later than I expected so maybe scheduling my evaluation for this week is better? If Thore (My facilitator) Feels like it and you'd like to have it fixed today, please schedule it. options are 22,23,26. Thanks :*
- [chandi] please always remove your reservations from the private room reservation sheets, it could otherwise quickly lead to confusions.
    - Doug is cleaning the sheets after every come
- [matthias] buying a bit more expensive roof things, e.g. new bricks & windows to have lower workload on people finding/getting good used stuff
- [matthias] Emptying bio bin didn't happen last week - do we want to implement a responsibility system as slack reminders seem to not be enough?
