    - right now there is not a use-case, so Matthias seems to be unsure. People who might have concerns or resistance are welcome to voice it!
    - [matthias] no concrete use case, but regularly useful in attic/basement/workshop or wherever there is big amounts of dirt to be vacuumed :)
- [Doug] 100m * 3mm braided hemp cord (geflochtenes Hanfseil) [27.90€](https://www.ebay.de/itm/Hanfseil-HEMPBRAID-geflochten-Hanf-Naturhanf-Seil-Schnur-Kordel-Leine/143560149642)
    - Plastic strings are degrading quite fast (espcially outside in the sun and for door indicators)
    - Zui proposes to show Doug other string techniques
    - feedback for Doug is welcome
- [lise and others] oats and sunflower seed 
    - see discussion section
- [Bodhi] 2-3 Gehörschutz 12€ per pair (for kitchen and workshop)
    - support!

### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Doug] need help to remove a piece of scaffolding: no skills required, one hour. Think if you're interested, then come to me.
  - [Doug] and now my heel is 'broken' :/
  - Antonin can imagine doing it
- [Tilmann & Matthias] K22 chimney removal discussion - should we have a fishbowl this week?
  - https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1610310449384800
  - It seems like people don't want to have a fishbowl before an ukuvote
- [Nathalie] more information on yoga room action: remove wallpaper, plaster holes (walls, ceiling). The room will be emptied before with temporary storage places for the things and cleaned on the end of the day to not block it for more than one day (although its still work in progress). Outlook for next steps: paint walls and ceiling. Everyone is welcome at any time! Time frame: till afternoon
    - Larissa and Chandi (?) are interested to join
- [Bodhi] Announcement: food sorting finished, see post in KH-food! also: don't collect oil bottles any more, expect for the ones with the "sunflower oil" label
- [lise] We're out of oats and sunflower seeds. maybe ordering at [Rolle Mühle](https://www.rolle-muehle.de/) because its organic (EU-organic lable) and the simplest for having it soon? 
    - 25kg sunflower seeds 47,50 (1,90€/kg), 25kg oats Kleinblatt 43,25€ (1,73€/kg) + 5,59€ delivery. Maybe a bit cheaper because of business discount. 
    - [Bodhi] rather 50kg of oats? [+]
    - bird sunflower seed were 25€ ~30€ but with quite some stones it in 
    - people are supportive of getting the order, maybe implementing easy ways to order without Lise
    - after this order, when the stocks are filled, Lise will look for a better solution (e.g. asking delivery conditions at Voigt Hof)
- [Larissa] Mika care is still appreciated - please continue using the sheet in the dining room, it gets wiped at the end of the week.

#### Round 2
- [Tilmann] kkW prep week from 2021-01-29 on?
    - [Nathalie] or from 2021-01-22 which gives 2 weeks prep time and time to get into the mood of community feeling
    - [lise] experiences from last MoIs showed that people need quite some time to think about what they want to do and then to prepare the actual sessions, so i'm in favor of two weeks. Then we can hopefully start with sessions in the Weeks of Introspection
    - Nathalie will check with Tilmann and put it in the calendar, other people didn't voice opinions
- [Nathalie] Whats the Moisture planning day on the 29th?
    - confusion. Check with Tilmann if it's a reminder for himself
- [Doug] move thinkpad charger from communal to office?
    - [Bodhi] exchange for round/square combo chager?
    - Lise thinks thats a great idea

- oh my god, already 11:00! Hurry to make the dinner lottery run, so we get awesome food this week!
