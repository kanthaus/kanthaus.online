<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- Doug: Matthias has deliberately changed our wifi network names. `wuppdays` now specifies the 5GHz network, and `wuppdays_slow` specifies the 2.4 GHz network (passwords are the same as the old one.) Users with (older) devices which only support 2.4 GHz and had previously connected to `wuppdays` will be (intentionally) disrupted. This change was made to reduce Bluetooth interference and to encourage those who can to use 5GHz (better performance for everyone). Posters will be updated by matthias today
- Doug: Getting a tumble dryer and using when it's cold and wet outside, how about it? Possibly better than drying inside: moisture not good for the buildings and potentially our health, drying in heated rooms reduces heating efficiency (no idea how much) and it's obviously faster ;p Heat-pump + condenser machines are very efficient (and cost >= 300€)...
  - Matthias: I think we get along without a tumble dryer. It's sometimes a bit tricky but so far it works.
  - Lise: But we'll need a solution without the yoga room at some point because it will be used for other things.
  - Tilmann: I think we should rather queue up the laundry and in future use an area outside that is under a roof. We will build one at some point, e.g. on the balcony.
  - Matthias: I'm afraid that we get into the habit of just getting new things whenever we want some more comfort.
  - Nathalie: But isn't it more about the point that we don't have that much moisture inside?
  - Matthias: Well, if we ventilate enough and there is no condensation then there's no problem. And so far I didn't see condensation in the yoga room.
- Who feels responsible for the poor lonely laundry outside?
  - Janina: Every time I look it is wet... :( I don't think I want to put dripping wet clothes in the yoga room or should I..?
  - Tilmann: should by dry by tonight, will take it down then
- When you get (analog) Mail, plz open it carefully (e.g. with a knife) and save the envelope. Silvan wants to use them for seed sorting and sharing.
- chandi: Please don't use tape on wallpaper (e.g. living room)
- chandi: Please don't use sharp knives on stone (plates) or metal (baking trays)
  - Doug: knives have all been straightened last week
- Janina: Last opening times of the clothes bank before it closes are this Tuesday and Thursday! I'll go shopping, who's in? (Matthias);)
- Janina: Frauke's request and how we handle it (Aman comes today)
- Clara, Nick: visitor engagement + project updates + etc. https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1547305902184900 / https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-public/issues/141 - next steps?
- Doug: is window replacement going ahead in dorm? Concern about how long it will take multiplied by need for those beds. (not blocking)
  - Matthias: Window replacement plans changed due to input from Christian. Still planned on doing soon, but likely starting in ground floor / first floor. See issue for more information.
- Doug: invites Bodhi to re-weld broken sewage pipe in k22 with him this week :) (with DIY PVC cement!)
- Bodhi: nighttime energy-consumption up by about 100W since 2 weeks, why?
  - Matthias: We have 16W for the server, 4W for the second access point in K20-1, 6W for the lights in K22
  - Bodhi: Thats still about 50W missing.. before is was about 60-70, now its ~140, when freezer not running) how much is the fan in the bathroom?
  - Matthias: ~18W, but not running often lately; the fan on the attic is 11-60W depending on setting)
  - Tilmann: We still have quite some baseline consumption that we don't have figured out. I want to take up this task and get more clarity.
- Nathalie: Shall we do the standup meeting more regularly? How about quarter to 10am with the perspective of having it even earlier in the future?
  - General agreement.
  - Will take place in the living room.
- Nathalie: There is the Wir haben es satt demo in Berlin on Saturday where Thore, Clara and I will participate in. If there are more interested people we should coordinate.
- Nick: I have a podcast plan (https://stealthisshow.com/s04e10/) for later this week that I already announced in Slack.
- Janina: Evening planning on the physical board?
- Janina: Loudness in K20-2 - how can it be preven
- Nathalie: Day clothes in bed? How strict is this rule?
  - Janina: I'd tell people who come in to undress immediately...^^
  - Lise: Yes, I really don't like people wearing their day clothes in bed.
