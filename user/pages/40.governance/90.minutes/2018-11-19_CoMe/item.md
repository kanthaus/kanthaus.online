<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning
- buy oil! - done!
- use fresh milk before UHT, leave lactose free for Lise
- some stuff to be washed in the dumpster kitchen

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Suggestion: Schedule an extra sharing event for the internal one and not replacing the regular one to not separate the groups
- Making an Adventskalender (Lise)
  - if people like it Lise would make an Adventscalendar and fill it with moneyfree things
  - Bodhi also finds it okay to put things in there we'd buy anyways, like screws or awesome coffee makers
  - Lise is happy about creative input and help from people making the calendar
- Follow-up room planning meeting! (Bodhi and Lise). Would be cool if you could plan this meeting so we can take part. Lise leaves Thu. or Fr.
  - Scheduled for this Wednesday at 10:00 - Transfer-people should not come, because it's a holiday
- Alexandra, woman making a documentary about Fausto, comes over the weekend (who is ok with being in the film, giving interviews?)
- Reminder: there is only two weeks left for the autumn roadmap!
- Proposal: who ever goes dumpster diving is responsible that the food is washed (this does not mean they need to wash it themselves, but to delegate this task) and whoever washes food is responsible that its gets sorted accordingly (this does not mean they need to sort it themselves, but to delegate this task).
  - Chandi thinks that this puts an additional burden on people going dumpster diving
  - Chandi will make a big sign that can be put up by the food shelf to make people aware that there is food that still needs to we washed/sorted in
- How is the status of the personal projects update thingy? Did it happen while I was gone? Should it happen soon? (Janina)
  - Did not happen so far, this week is a bit tight with everyone wanting to participate. Maybe next week on Tuesday evening it could happen in the old way?
- The veggies from our garden need to be harvested! Silvan will do it today, immediately after CoMe, Isabel will help.
- Please be aware of the food-sorting-system in the kitchen! Or make other proposals how it could be structured. (Lise would like to give a short tour / introduction in front of the shelves)
  - categories are: sugar/sweetening stuff, random stuff, baking stuff, flour in small amounts, milk powder & cacao, müsli stuff, seeds & nuts, dried fruits, grainy products to cook with (rice, lentils, pasta)
  - grill sauces and pickles will go into the top section of the white shelf in the snack kitchen
  - snack veggies and fruits will go in the lower section of the white shelf - then the kitchen table can be completely free again
  - the order in the fridge will be reestablished by Lise and then people will hopefully stick to it (but we are all hopeful)
  - the sink in the snack kitchen is awfully dirty very often - people are invited to clean it right after emptying teapots and other things into it
  - Bodhi gives an introduction to the dish-washer
- Isabel shares that she's organizing moving to Dusseldorf towards the end of November.

### 8. For next week
- Personal projects update meeting on Tuesday evening? (Janina, Bodhi, Silvan)
- Longer heating periods when it gets colder and colder now? (Silvan, Chandi)
