### 3. Shopping plans
- plumbing stuff still in the pipeline

### 4. Discussion & Announcements
- [Thore] Oatly pickup on Wednesday?
    - Nathalie is in contact with Tina
- [Lise] next monday there is the Gehweg-Kontrolle, so our pavement should be clean.... Some volunteering? Or adding the task to the PowerHour this week?
    - it could be done during the teamtime (or powerhour). Janina and Antonin feel up for it
- [Doug] I would like to be responsible for maintaining the sleeping room indicators sheets! (Found out Hipster room one was broken: string too thin) Please tell me if you find issues/have ideas.
- [Lise] I'd like to reserve the Private for 1-2 weeks. I don't need to sleep there all the nights. If you'd like to sleep there, please tell me.
- [Doug] I don't think the bin in k22-upper toilet was emptied last power hour: I propose that all bathroom bins are emptied weekly as part of power hour.
  - [Antonin] is responsible for this oversight and is now aware of the existence of this toilet
- [Doug] ~~printer/scanner USB stick missing?~~ It's back now!
  - [Tilmann] saw it there yesterday
- [Tilmann] Corona framework possibly not in effect anymore due to R>1, how to continue?
  - 7-Tages-R > 1 since 2020-09-04, in Saxony since 2020-09-10
- [Lise] I signed up for the Asian buffet pick up on Tuesday. I guess Antonin is joining me. So no need to cook in the evening.
- [Silvan] I think we need a plan for watering the garden plants this week. I would say, they need to get water every two days. Who could care about it (watering or plan)?
  - Lise will try to have the overview and eventually prod people
- [Janina] Mika care requests: Potentially Tuesday morning during teamtime and over the weekend when I'm in Berlin and Tilmann might want to do roof stuff.
- [Janina] Lunch team this week?
  - Participants: Antonin, Thore, Nathalie, Tilmann, Janina
