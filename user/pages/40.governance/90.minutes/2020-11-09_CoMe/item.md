### 4. Discussion & Announcements

- [Janina] Winter social prep: There is now a pad that is meant to facilitate small group action: https://codi.kanthaus.online/winter-storm-prep?edit
    - [Janina] I'd like to try out the allocation of sleeping spots for a whole week. How about this week? :)
    - [Janina] I made a thing on karrot to organize it but we can also make a physical sheet of course.
    - Not much enthusiasm, but also no resistance. Janina will make a clear proposal for next week.
- [Doug] please use smaller towels if possible :) We don't have enough space for everyone to have bigger towels right now.
- [Larissa] Who would like to come on a bicycle trip to Jahnishausen this week and picking up pumpkins?
- [Matthias] Heating coordination (extra meeting to find out needs? Heat the piano room by default as well? How about individually spontaneously heat private rooms?)
  - [Doug] I appreciate people bringing proposals to CoMe if they have a good idea, rather than bringing in discussion topics ;p
  - Proposal: Warm rooms by default can be the main office, dining room, kitchen, elephant room, piano room, fansipan, bathroom
- [Matthias] ... Ventilate ventilate ventilate!
  - Open windows on two sides of the house, leave for 1-5 minutes (depending on wind), close again.
  - Especially important when rooms cool down (e.g. when turning off radiator or in the evening).
  - Want to ventilate less? Keep moisture out!
    - Keep doors closed
    - Especially the bathroom door seems to stay open often
    - The less moisture in a towel/in the room, the less moisture needs to be ventilated away!
      - Shake hands dry before using a towel
      - Strip water off body before using towel
      - Use sponge to take away water from surfaces and squeeze it out into sink afterwards
- [Janina] Theatre group seems to be dead..? I won't push it anymore so if nobody else wants to feel responsible for making it happen, I would suggest to remove it from the weekly schedule.
    - [Zui] I already removed it. I could offer differently focused theatre workshops but that would be a different thing.
- [Doug] Shoerack: some parts use string or wire—let's change them all to rubber! Resistance? Someone else want to do it?
    - No resistance, Silvan and Doug will talk about it.
- [Matthias] Bicycle Repair station project: I would do a quick version to get it out of my mind. Anybody motivated to jump in or take over?
    - Tilmann also feels responsible and is up for helping, preferably on days which are not good for roof work.
- [Doug] I need to silicone in one of the pipe caps: please don't use staircase toilets today.
- [Silvan] Request of Anna Lotta
  - https://yunity.slack.com/files/USLACKBOT/F01E5QE1MFW/re__anfrage_f__r_ein_forschungsprojekt__bachelorarbeit__und_mitwohnen__phancy_physialis_
  - when is MoI?
    - [Tilmann] Vote outcome seems to indicate February 2021 https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1604049691061300
- [Janina] Move CoMe to a bigger room for next week? Maybe piano room?
    - Support.
- [Anja] there is food to be washed in the dumpster kitchen!
- [Maxime] Potato status: There are still boxes in the hallway, the potatos are slowly deteriorating.
    - Next to be eaten: in front of lower staircase toilet
