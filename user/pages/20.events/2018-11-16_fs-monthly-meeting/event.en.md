Normally we host the monthly meeting of Wurzen's foodsavers every 2nd Thursday a month at 7pm  at Kanthaus. This month however, the date changed to the 3rd Thursday - apart from that everything happens as usual.
We plan the future of local foodsaving, strengthen our community, share food and spend a nice evening together. Be part of it!

Depending on what is going on topics are the following:
- maintaining existing cooperations
- building new cooperations
- planning, building and running a [Food-Share Point](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FSINT/pages/43909145/Food-Share+Point+Mini+Manual)
- planning and/or retrospective of special events like
  - info desks
  - distribtions of saved food
  - special pickups, e.g. christmas market or festival pickups
  - KifA (kitchen for all), where saved food gets cooked and eaten together
  - workshops to make food long-lasting
  - gleaning actions
