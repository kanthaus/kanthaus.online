The very first hackathon Kanthaus will host will benefit [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) of course!

Matthias is happy to invite developers, who want to work on the legacy PHP code with him. There will be focused work, saved food and a special atmosphere of community and everything is free of charge!
