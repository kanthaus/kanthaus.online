### 4. Discussion & Announcements

#### Round 1
- [Lise] CoMe These days is quite crowded in the dining room. How about trying out the piano room Next week? Concerns resistance?
    - No resistance. It will be in the Piano Room. Don't forget! ;)
- [Anja] thanks to many people there is a looooot of food to be washed!
    - [Bodhi] proposel towards food washing: Don't wash frozen veggies, but put them outside so they stay frozen and cook with them direcly, and wash them immediately before. Otherwise they become very soft and disgusting after washing. we threw away a loot of veggies last week becuase they were unfrozen and then not immetiately used. I also propose to compost all frozen lettuce, as it would be very sad if we eat this not-nice lettuce while the 4 boxes of amazing lettuce in the basement go bad.
    - Salad in the basement should be eaten (it was never in a dumpster)
- [Silvan] Acrolotl?
    - Can the headquarters be here? Other locations aren't available. 2 people would come on Friday evening and leave on Sunday.
    - General point: How do we deal with processes like this? 
    - No resistance, some concerns.
- [?] Should we have Social Sauna this week?
    - No! 
    - We would like to keep the regular schedule of Social Sauna. 
    - There is no resistance to having social sauna next week, some concerns. So we have it next week and then continue in the normal schedule.

#### Round 2
- [tilmann] new Mika caretaker schedule: calendar-like sheet to be able to sign up for shorter periods. would be happy if people use it to give me some planned Mika-free time!
