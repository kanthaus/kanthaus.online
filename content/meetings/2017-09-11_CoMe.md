title: Coordination Meeting
date: 2017-09-11

<!-- Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if it goes off-topic/too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Stop the meeting at 11:00 latest. (There is always more to talk about and the important stuff will not be forgotten.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Upload the notes as soon as possible. (People can then be reminded of what happened and what they said they would do.)
  - Have fun!
-->
