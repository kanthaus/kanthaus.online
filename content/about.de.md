There is life again in the houses Kantstraße 20 and 22 (in Wurzen near Leipzig, Germany). We, a small group of people, are dreaming of building a house, open for community and projects. Providing an environment for people to live to their full potential and create a conscious and responsible society is what we strive for. We want to base our actions on our values instead of the status quo, think and live independently and authentically. Self-determination, equality and acceptance are our main values and we would love them to be lived and spread over the world. To take the opposites: by our actions in Wurzen we want to minimize coercion, inequality and opposition. Our main purposes are to develop free, libre and open source software, to provide and connect public and common pool resources and to give what we can, take what we need and facilitate others to do the same. In short this means creating room in the city: e.g. open workshops, working-/seminar-/ and social spaces and playing an active role in Wurzen and the wider world.

There are enough resources, they only need to be distributed more fairly.**Reduce Waste. Promote Sharing**
